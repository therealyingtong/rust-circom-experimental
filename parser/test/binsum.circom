Binary Sum
==========

This component creates a binary sum componet of ops operands and n bits each operand.

e is Number of carries: Depends on the number of operands in the input.

Main Constraint:
   in[0][0]     * 2^0  +  in[0][1]     * 2^1  + ..... + in[0][n-1]    * 2^(n-1)  +
 + in[1][0]     * 2^0  +  in[1][1]     * 2^1  + ..... + in[1][n-1]    * 2^(n-1)  +
 + ..
 + in[ops-1][0] * 2^0  +  in[ops-1][1] * 2^1  + ..... + in[ops-1][n-1] * 2^(n-1)  +
 ===
   out[0] * 2^0  + out[1] * 2^1 +   + out[n+e-1] *2(n+e-1)

To waranty binary outputs:

    out[0]     * (out[0] - 1) === 0
    out[1]     * (out[0] - 1) === 0
    .
    .
    .
    out[n+e-1] * (out[n+e-1] - 1) == 0

    This function calculates the number of extra bits in the output to do the full sum.
